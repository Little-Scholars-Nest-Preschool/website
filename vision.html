        <h4> Our Journey </h4>
        <p> The journey of Little Scholars Nest Preschool began in early May of 2007. Our founder and Facility Director Mrs. Shalini Srivastava brings along her experience as a teacher and child care provider in California for many years. As a passionate Facility Director, she has built an environment where every child receives abundant love and attention from professionally trained teachers. <p>
		<p> In 2019, we will be completing our 12th year of Little Scholars Nest Preschool with over 100 Little Scholar graduates now having left the nest and sprouting their wings. We are beyond proud of all of our Little Scholars and their achievements as active and aware citizens of our rapidly changing world. Our preschool fosters years of experience in early childhood education which we bring to the classroom, playground, and nap room every day.

    	<p> <strong> At Little Scholars Nest we believe that the early years of a child’s life are the most significant period </strong> as this is when the foundation is laid for the overall development of the individual. We have prepared a preschool environment that is calm, engaging, and responsive to each individual child at all stages of development. Most importantly, children are loved and made to feel cherished to ensure that they approach life with a positive attitude. </p>
    	<p> Along with providing the knowledge of different academic concepts, we also emphasize on inculcating life skills like confidence, leadership, empathy, and courage. Our mission is to usher your child into a world of possibilities where their personality blossoms. We provide a quality and integrated program where children can grow intellectually, physically, socially, and emotionally. Our foundational commitment is to provide nurturing care that compliments values learned at home and develops high character and conduct. </p>
    	<p> We accept all children, that we are licensed to serve, without any regard to ethnic background, gender or creed. All of our teachers have years of work experience and a Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree. They exceed all qualifications required for preschool teachers as per the California Licensing Standards. Each adult on our facility meets the following requirements: fingerprinted, TB tested, Early Childhood Education Certified, California Basic Educational Skills Test, Certified in Infant and Child First Aid, and CPR Certified for Child Health and Safety. Our facility is licensed by Community Care Licensing through the State of California. </p>
