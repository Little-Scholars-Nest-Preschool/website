    	<p> We offer full-time and part-time, age-appropriate preschool classes for children aged two and a half years to five years old. All preschool programs have a set curriculum that incorporates phonics-based reading, math concepts, science, music, movement, social studies, arts and crafts, public speaking, and Montessori time. </p>
		<p> Here is an overview of our daily schedule (this schedule is subject to change based on holiday celebrations and other special events): 
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Welcome to School & Social Time (8:30 am to 9:00 am) </strong> </h5>
		<p>“Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.” – Maria Montessori. Your child will begin their day with hands-on material of their choice which gives them the opportunity to make a decision and build independence.</p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Circle Time (9:00 am to 10:00 am) </strong> </h5>
		<p>In our daily Circle Time, we review the week calendar, daily weather report, theme-based songs, and verbal learning based on the monthly curriculum. This is followed by stretching exercises and movement with music. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Academics Jam (10:00 am to 11:00 am) </strong> </h5>
		<p> Our study time focuses strongly on academics and building positive classroom skills. We emphasize on verbal learning through various hands-on activities, followed by our daily written practice packets. After academics, we switch to our creative mindset to do cutting, pasting, painting, and coloring based on our weekly themes. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Reading Time (11:00 am to 11:30 am) </strong> </h5>
		<p> The purpose of reading time to open a new world to our Little Scholars through the power of children's stories and books. We focus heavily on Emergent Reading Skills, as we introduce your child to basic phonics as early as age three. We have a highly successful reading program with all our pre-kindergarten students being fluent readers by the time of graduation.</p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Lunch Time (11:30 am to 12:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> We understand healthy eating habits are crucial to your child's overall development. </h5>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Outdoor Playtime (12:30 pm to 2:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> Here at Little Scholar’s Nest, we believe that physical development is equally as important as academics and personality development. We have a large outdoor facility surrounded by beautiful nature for children to develop their gross motor skills and socialize on the playground. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-purple"> <strong> Extended Care Begins </strong> at 1:00 pm. This is the transition from the part-time to full-time program. </h5>
		<p> </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Nap Time (2:00 pm to 3:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> After a long day of learning and exercising, our Little Scholars need some rest! Every child brings their favorite blanky and pillow from home as we fall asleep to a peaceful, loving lullaby. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Afternoon Snack Time (3:00 pm to 4:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> We reinforce healthy eating habits with afternoon milk and a nutritious snack brought from home. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> Evening Activity Time (4:00 pm to 6:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> Extended care activities vary each day. Activities include drawing, coloring, pretend play, constructive play with Legos, magnet tiles, tangrams, lacing, beading, and socializing time for our Little Scholars. </p>
		
		<h5 class="text-info"> <strong> School Closes (6:00 pm) </strong> </h5>
		<p> See you tomorrow! </p>
