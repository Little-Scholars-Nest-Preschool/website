		"Gentle, loving, caring, home away from home..Shalini's Little Scholars Nest was a great place to be for my kids over the summer. You will be always greeted with a smile at the door, at pick up or drop off, your concerns will always be heard, and you can be rest assured your child is getting the best care away from home. Classrooms are neat and clean, well-organized, activities planned to keep your child involved and happy, routine followed from breakfast to lunch to nap time to outdoor play so your child is comfortable and knows what to expect. Above all, Shalini is great with kids, understanding, and patient and loving. It's hard to find childcare like this these days."
